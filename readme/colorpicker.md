## About Color Picker

  

The above tools is built using the [HTML 5's canvas API's](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API) `getImageData` function. This function will return an array of pixel data for the image loaded on the given canvas.

You can read all about it here on my medium post - [https://levelup.gitconnected.com/how-to-extract-the-colour-of-a-pixel-using-javascript-html-5-f3661f54473](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/how-to-extract-the-colour-of-a-pixel-using-javascript-html-5-f3661f54473)

Code for this tool is part of a react component and it can be found here - [https://github.com/metacollective9/canvasfun](https://github.com/metacollective9/canvasfun)
